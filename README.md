# Flight Booker

This project is from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker) Ruby on Rails/Advances Forms and Active Record section. The objective is to build a website where a user can select a flight from a dropdown of available flights.

This application was built upon in a second project called [Sending Confirmation Emails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sending-confirmation-emails#null), which had me set up a feature to send emails to all passengers upon a successful booking.
